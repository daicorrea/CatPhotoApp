----- Bootstrap ------
-----------------------

-> Browsers read CSS from top to bottom.

-> Responsive Design <-
    Bootstrap is responsible to know the size you are using your screen and it will
    automatically resize your HTML elements. This include mobile and tablet versions so 
    when you use this framework you don't need to create another version of your website.

-> Containers <-
    Bootstrap needs to use a containing element to wrap the content and adjust its grid. 
    There are two container options: 
    1) Responsive fixed width container.
    Ex: <div class="container">...</div>
    2) Full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.
    Ex: <div class="container-fluid">...</div>

-> Images <-
    Using the img-responsive it's possible to adjust the image with the screen's width automatically.
