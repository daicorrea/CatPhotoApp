----- Bootstrap ------
-----------------------

-> Browsers read CSS from top to bottom.

-> Responsive Design <-
    Bootstrap is responsible to know the size you are using your screen and it will
    automatically resize your HTML elements. This include mobile and tablet versions so 
    when you use this framework you don't need to create another version of your website.

-> Containers <-
    Bootstrap needs to use a containing element to wrap the content and adjust its grid. 
    There are two container options: 
    1) Responsive fixed width container.
    Ex: <div class="container">...</div>
    2) Full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.
    Ex: <div class="container-fluid">...</div>

-> Images <-
    Using the img-responsive it's possible to adjust the image with the screen's width automatically. 

-> Block Elements <-
    When using a Block Element your element will fill your page's 100% width
    and any elements after it will got to another line below the block.

-> Grid System <-
    Bootstrap has a 12 column grid layout used to facilitate putting elements side by side and
    specify each width. An image example can be found on /images/bootstrap-grid-example.png
    Ex: <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-x">: md means medium and x is the number representing how many columns wide the element should be.
    Ex2: <div class="row"> <div class="col-xs-x">: xs means extra small.
