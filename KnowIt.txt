--- Just Some Notes ---

-> Padding vs Margin <-
padding - controls the amount of space between the element and its border (On the inside).
margin - controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements (On the outside).

-> Clockwise Notation <-
Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, 
padding-bottom, and padding-left properties, 
you can specify them all in one line, like this:
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
