--- Just Some Notes ---

* Browsers read CSS from top to bottom

-> Padding vs Margin <-
padding - controls the amount of space between the element and its border (On the inside).
margin - controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements (On the outside).

-> Clockwise Notation <-
Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, 
padding-bottom, and padding-left properties, 
you can specify them all in one line.
Ex: padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

-> Override CSS in the Same Element <-
The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. 
Because class2 is declared second, it overrides the attributes of class1.
Ex: class="class1 class2"
